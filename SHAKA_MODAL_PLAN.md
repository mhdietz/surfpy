# Shaka Modal Feature Implementation Plan

This document outlines the steps to implement and test the `ShakaModal` component, which displays a list of users who have reacted to a session.

### 1. Component Scaffolding

-   [x] **Step 1.1: Create File:** Create the file `frontend/src/components/ShakaModal.jsx`.
-   [x] **Step 1.2: Basic Modal Structure:**
    -   [x] Build the static JSX for the modal (backdrop, container, title, close button).
    -   [x] The component will be designed to accept two props: `users` (an array of user objects) and `onClose` (a function).
    -   [x] Add a placeholder for the list of users.

### 2. Initial Integration & Preview

This phase focuses on connecting the `ShakaModal` to its trigger point, the `SessionTile` component.

-   [x] **Step 2.1: Add Control State to `SessionTile.jsx`:** Add an `isShakaModalOpen` state to the `SessionTile`.
-   [x] **Step 2.2: Connect Toggle and Render:**
    -   [x] Make the shaka count element in the `SessionTile` clickable to open the modal.
    -   [x] Conditionally render `<ShakaModal />` based on the state.
    -   [x] Pass the `onClose` handler and the list of users from the session data to the modal's props.
-   [x] **Step 2.3: Initial Testing:** Verify that clicking the shaka count opens and closes the static modal.

### 3. Component Logic & Display

This phase focuses on making the component display the user data correctly.

-   [x] **Step 3.1: Render User List:** Map over the `users` prop to display each user's name, making each a clickable `Link` to their journal page.
-   [x] **Step 3.2: Handle Empty State:** If the `users` array is empty, display an appropriate message (e.g., "No shakas yet.").

### 4. Final Testing

-   [x] **Step 4.1: Display & Navigation:** Verify the modal correctly displays the list of users and that clicking a user navigates to their journal.
-   [x] **Step 4.2: Empty State:** Verify the empty state message appears correctly.
