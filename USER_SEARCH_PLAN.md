# User Search Feature Implementation Plan

This document outlines the steps to implement, integrate, and test the User Search modal feature. We will update the checkboxes as we complete each step.

### 1. Component Scaffolding

-   [x] **Step 1.1: Create File:** Create the file `frontend/src/components/UserSearch.jsx`.
-   [x] **Step 1.2: Basic Modal Structure:** Build the static JSX for the modal, including a backdrop, a container, a title, a close button, and a placeholder for search results.

### 2. Initial Integration & Preview

This phase focuses on connecting the `UserSearch` component to the main application so it can be previewed.

-   [x] **Step 2.1: Add Control State to `Navigation.jsx`:** Add an `isSearchOpen` state to the `Navigation` component.
-   [x] **Step 2.2: Connect Toggle and Render:** Make the search icon in the header clickable to open the modal and conditionally render the `<UserSearch />` component.
-   [x] **Step 2.3: Initial Testing:** Verify that the static modal opens and closes correctly.

### 3. Component Logic

This phase focuses on making the component functional.

-   [x] **Step 3.1: Implement State Management:** Add the component's internal state for `query`, `results`, `loading`, and `error`.
-   [x] **Step 3.2: API Logic:** Implement the `useEffect` hook to fetch data from the API with debouncing.
-   [x] **Step 3.3: Render Logic:** Implement the conditional rendering for loading/error states and the list of results.

### 4. Final Testing

-   [x] **Step 4.1: Search & Results:** Verify that searching for a user displays a spinner and then a list of results.
-   [x] **Step 4.2: Navigation:** Verify that clicking a user navigates to their journal page.
-   [x] **Step 4.3: Edge Cases:** Verify "No users found" and error messages.
