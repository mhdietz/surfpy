# SessionTile Component Development Plan

## 1. Objective

The goal is to create a `SessionTile` component that is both data-complete and interactive. The component's completion will be judged by two criteria:
1.  All key data fields are correctly displayed.
2.  The component correctly navigates to other pages.

## 2. Development Plan

-   **Step 1: Display All Data (Completed)**: The component now correctly renders the user's name, date, notes, rating, and participant names from the mock data.

-   **Step 2: Implement Navigation (Queued)**:
    -   **Action**: Modify `frontend/src/components/SessionTile.jsx`.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   (Completed) Make the entire tile clickable to navigate to the session detail page (e.g., `/session/123`).
        -   (Completed) Make the creator's display name clickable to navigate to their journal page.
        -   (Completed) Make the participant's display names clickable to navigate to their respective journal pages.

## 3. Definition of Done

The `SessionTile` will be considered complete for this phase when it both displays all data and all navigation paths are functional.

## 4. Deferred Items

-   **Shaka API Toggle**: The logic for making the shaka button call the backend API is deferred.
-   **UI Polish**: The addition of icons and other design improvements are deferred.
