# SessionTile Component Development Plan

## 1. Objective

The goal is to create a minimal `SessionTile` component that correctly displays all key information for a surf session. The component's completion will be judged by the visible presence of the following fields from the mock data:

-   User's display name
-   Session date
-   Session notes
-   Fun rating
-   A count of other participants
-   A count of shaka reactions

## 2. Development Plan

-   **Step 1: Update Mock Data (Completed)**:
    -   **Action**: Modified the `mockSession` object in `frontend/src/utils/mockData.js`.
    -   **Change**: Added a `session_notes` field.

-   **Step 2: Update SessionTile Component (Completed)**:
    -   **Action**: Modified `frontend/src/components/SessionTile.jsx`.
    -   **Changes**: Ensured the component's JSX explicitly renders the `display_name`, the formatted `session_date`, `session_notes`, `fun_rating`, the number of `participants`, and the `shakas.count`.

## 3. Definition of Done

The `SessionTile` is now considered complete for this stage, as all fields listed in the objective are rendered from the mock data. All other work (interactivity, icons, layout) is deferred.
