# Navigation Component Development Plan

## 1. Objective

The `Navigation` component will provide the primary application shell, including a fixed top header and a fixed bottom navigation bar. Its purpose is to facilitate seamless routing between core application pages and provide access to user-specific actions like search and profile management.

## 2. Component Definition

-   **File Location**: `frontend/src/components/Navigation.jsx`
-   **Structure**: The component will consist of two main, fixed elements:
    -   A top header (e.g., for app title, search icon, profile dropdown).
    -   A bottom navigation bar (e.g., for main page links).
-   **Dependencies**: It will utilize `react-router-dom` for navigation (`Link`, `useNavigate`, `useLocation`) and the `AuthContext` for user authentication status.

## 3. Development Plan

-   **Step 1: Basic Structure (Header & Bottom Nav) (Completed)**:
    -   **Action**: Create the `Navigation.jsx` file.
    -   **Details**:
        -   Implement a fixed top header with a placeholder for the app title/logo.
        -   Implement a fixed bottom navigation bar with placeholder links for "My Journal", "Create Session", and "Feed" (in that order).
        -   Apply basic Tailwind CSS for positioning (`fixed`, `bottom-0`, `top-0`), background (`bg-white`), and shadows (`shadow`).

-   **Step 2: Implement Navigation Links & Active State (Completed)**:
    -   **Action**: Connect the navigation placeholders to actual routes and add visual feedback for the active page.
    -   **Details**:
        -   Use `Link` components from `react-router-dom` for all navigation items.
        -   Ensure the links correctly point to `/journal`, `/create-session`, and `/feed`.
        -   Use the `useLocation` hook to determine the current path and apply distinct styling (e.g., `text-blue-600`, `font-bold`) to the active navigation item.

-   **Step 3: Header Functionality (User Search & Profile Dropdown) (Completed)**:
    -   **Action**: Add interactive elements to the header.
    -   **Details**:
        -   Include a placeholder for a user search icon.
        -   Implement a basic user profile dropdown.
        -   Integrate the `useAuth` context for authentication status.

-   **Step 4: Integrate into `App.jsx` (Completed)**:
    -   **Action**: Render the `Navigation` component in the main application entry point.
    -   **Details**:
        -   Modify `frontend/src/App.jsx` to import and render the `Navigation` component.
        -   Ensure `Navigation` is rendered outside of the `Routes` component.

## 4. Testing

Initial testing will be manual by observing the component's behavior in the browser:
-   Verify that the header and bottom navigation bars are always visible and fixed in position.
-   Verify that clicking each navigation link correctly changes the URL and loads the corresponding page.
-   Verify that the active link styling works correctly.
-   Verify that the user search icon and profile dropdown placeholders are visible.
-   Verify that the profile dropdown conditionally renders based on authentication status.
-   Verify that the `ProtectedRoute` still functions correctly.
