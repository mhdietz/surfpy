## ✅ 1. Research & Station Mapping (2 hours) - COMPLETE

The first step is to identify the best weather station for each of our predefined surf spots. We will use the NOAA API and online tools to find the closest, most reliable station for each location.

**Tasks:**
1.  ✅ **Get Surf Spot Coordinates:** Extract the `slug`, `wind_lat`, and `wind_long` for all surf spots from the `surf_spots_rows_5.csv` file.
2.  ✅ **Find Stations via API:** For each coordinate pair, use the NOAA API endpoint `https://api.weather.gov/points/{lat},{lon}` to get the `observationStations` URL.
3.  ✅ **Verify Station IDs:** Fetch the `observationStations` URL to get a list of station URLs. The station ID is the last component of the URL (e.g., `https://api.weather.gov/stations/KSQL` -> `KSQL`). We will use these official IDs.
4.  ✅ **Select Best Stations:** From the list of nearby stations, select the top 2-3 closest ones that provide reliable wind data. This provides a fallback option.
5.  ✅ **Document Mappings:** Create a definitive list of `slug -> [primary_station_id, secondary_station_id]` mappings.

**✅ COMPLETED MAPPING RESULTS:**
*Research completed using automated Python script. All station IDs verified and tested for wind data availability.*

**Key Improvements Achieved:**
- **Santa Cruz spots**: 71.2 miles (old buoy) → 2.5-3.6 miles (weather stations)
- **Average distance reduction**: 39.2 miles → ~15 miles across all spots
- **All stations verified** to have active wind data
- **Fallback stations provided** for redundancy

## 2. Code Implementation (4 hours)

### `surfpy` Layer (2 hours)
-   **File:** `surfpy/weatherapi.py`
-   **Task 1: Create `fetch_station_observations` function.**
    -   Signature: `fetch_station_observations(station_id, start_date, end_date)`.
    -   Construct URL: `https://api.weather.gov/stations/{station_id}/observations?start={start_date_iso}&end={end_date_iso}`.
    -   Make the HTTP request and handle potential errors (e.g., 404, 500).
-   **Task 2: Create `parse_station_observations` function.**
    -   This function will take the JSON response from the API.
    -   It will iterate through the `features` array.
    -   For each observation, it will parse `windDirection.value` and `windSpeed.value`.
    -   **Unit Conversion:** Wind speed from the API is in km/h. It will be converted to **knots**.
    -   It will create and return a list of `BuoyData` objects.

### `ocean_data` Layer (1.5 hours)
-   **File:** `ocean_data/meteorology.py`
-   **Task 1: Modify `fetch_meteorological_data`.**
    -   Change signature to accept `weather_station_ids` (a list) and `target_datetime`.
    -   Iterate through the `weather_station_ids`:
        -   Call `surfpy.weatherapi.fetch_station_observations` for a 1-hour window around the `target_datetime`.
        -   If data is returned, process it and return. Use `find_closest_data` to select the best observation from the list.
        -   If the primary station fails, log the failure and try the next station in the list.
    -   If all stations fail, return `None`.
-   **File:** `ocean_data/location.py`
-   **Task 2: Update `get_spot_config`.**
    -   The query will be updated to pull the list of `weather_station_ids`.

### `surfdata.py` API Layer (0.5 hours)
-   **File:** `surfdata.py`
-   **Task 1: Update `create_surf_session` logic.**
    -   The call to `get_spot_config` will now return a list of `weather_station_ids`.
    -   The call to `fetch_meteorological_data` will pass this list.
    -   The `met_buoy_id` field will be changed to `weather_station_id` when saving the session.

---

## 3. Database Schema & Data Migration (1 hour)

**Tasks:**
1.  **Schema Change (0.5 hours):**
    -   `surf_spots` table: Rename `met_buoy_id` to `weather_station_ids` and change type to `TEXT[]` to hold an array of station IDs.
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE surf_spots RENAME COLUMN met_buoy_id TO weather_station_ids;
    ALTER TABLE surf_spots ALTER COLUMN weather_station_ids TYPE TEXT[];
    ```
    -   `surf_sessions_duplicate` table: Rename `met_buoy_id` to `weather_station_id` and change type to `VARCHAR(10)` to store the ID of the station that successfully returned data.
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE surf_sessions_duplicate RENAME COLUMN met_buoy_id TO weather_station_id;
    ALTER TABLE surf_sessions_duplicate ALTER COLUMN weather_station_id TYPE VARCHAR(10);
    ```
2.  **Data Migration (0.5 hours):**
    -   ✅ **Migration script ready**: `weather_station_migration.sql` contains all UPDATE statements
    -   Execute the generated SQL to populate `weather_station_ids` arrays for all spots:
    ```sql
    UPDATE surf_spots SET weather_station_ids = ARRAY['AP803','C9585','XCDC1'] WHERE slug = 'steamer-lane';
    UPDATE surf_spots SET weather_station_ids = ARRAY['C9585','AP803','CTOC1'] WHERE slug = 'privates';
    -- ... (14 more UPDATE statements in migration file)
    ```

## 4. Testing Strategy (2 hours)

**Tasks:**
1.  **Unit Tests (1 hour):**
    -   Create `surfpy/tests/test_weatherapi.py`.
    -   Test `fetch_station_observations` for both success and failure cases (mocking `requests.get`).
    -   Test `parse_station_observations` with sample JSON to verify correct `BuoyData` creation and unit conversion to knots.
2.  **Integration Test (1 hour):**
    -   Modify `test_db_functions.py`.
    -   Test the full flow: post a session, verify the correct `weather_station_id` is saved, and confirm `raw_met` contains valid wind data.
    -   Add a test case where the primary station fails to ensure the fallback logic works correctly.

---

## 5. Rollout Strategy (0.5 hours)

This will be a single, coordinated deployment.
**Sequence:**
1.  Apply the database schema changes (`ALTER TABLE`).
2.  Run the data migration script (`UPDATE` statements from `weather_station_migration.sql`).
3.  Deploy the updated backend code.
4.  Run integration tests to confirm the end-to-end flow is working.
5.  Commit the changes.
